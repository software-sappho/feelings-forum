Absolutely! Let’s do the same style deep dive for your `database` package code. Here’s an explanation, line-by-line, concept-by-concept:

---

```go
package database
```

### 1. Why `package database`?

This defines the package name.

* You want this code to be imported and used by other parts of your program (e.g., `main.go`).
* It groups related DB logic separately from your web server logic, for cleaner design.

---

```go
import (
	"database/sql"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	"path/filepath"

	_ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"
)
```

### 2. What are these imports doing?

* `"database/sql"`: Go’s **generic database API** — provides common DB operations (query, exec, etc).
* `"fmt"`: for formatting errors and strings.
* `"os"` and `"path/filepath"`: to work with file reading and paths (to load `.sql` files).
* `"_ "github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3"`:
  The underscore means **import for side-effects only** — it registers the SQLite3 driver so `database/sql` can use it under the hood.

---

```go
var DB *sql.DB
```

### 3. What is `var DB *sql.DB`?

* `*sql.DB` is a handle representing a **connection pool** to your database (SQLite here).
* Declared globally so multiple functions can use the same DB connection.

---

```go
func InitDB() error {
```

### 4. What’s `InitDB` for?

* Initializes the database connection.
* Returns an error if anything goes wrong — caller can handle or fatal exit.

---

```go
	DB, err = sql.Open("sqlite3", "forum.db")
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
```

### 5. What does `sql.Open` do?

* Opens a connection to the SQLite file `forum.db` (creates if missing).
* Doesn't actually connect immediately — prepares the connection.
* Returns error if the driver is missing or file can’t be opened.

---

```go
	if err = DB.Ping(); err != nil {
		return err
	}
```

### 6. What is `DB.Ping()`?

* Tests if the DB connection works.
* Useful to catch issues early before running queries.

---

```go
	files, err := filepath.Glob("sql_tables/*.sql")
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
```

### 7. What’s happening here?

* Uses `filepath.Glob` to find **all `.sql` files in the folder `sql_tables`**.
* This lets you keep your DB schema (like `CREATE TABLE`) in separate SQL files, nice for organization.

---

```go
	for _, file := range files {
		sqlBytes, err := os.ReadFile(file)
		if err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("failed to read %s: %v", file, err)
		}
```

### 8. Why read each SQL file?

* Reads the raw SQL commands from the file so you can execute them programmatically.

---

```go
		sqlStmt := string(sqlBytes)

		if _, err := DB.Exec(sqlStmt); err != nil {
			return fmt.Errorf("failed to execute %s: %v", file, err)
		}
	}
```

### 9. What does `DB.Exec(sqlStmt)` do?

* Runs the SQL statement on your SQLite database.
* This is where tables are created or updated according to the `.sql` files.
* If an error happens (e.g., syntax error or trying to create a table that already exists without `IF NOT EXISTS`), it returns it.

---

```go
	return nil
}
```

### 10. Why return nil here?

* Means initialization succeeded with no errors.
* The caller (like `main.go`) can then safely continue.

---

```go
func Exec(query string, args ...interface{}) (sql.Result, error) {
	return DB.Exec(query, args...)
}
```

### 11. What is this helper function for?

* A simple wrapper around `DB.Exec` that your other packages can call.
* Takes SQL query with placeholders (`?`) and parameters (`args`), executes them safely.
* Returns `sql.Result` (info about rows affected) and `error`.

### **Summary table**

| Code element         | What it means                        | Why it matters                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| `package database`   | Defines this code as DB logic        | Organizes code, easy to import         |
| `sql.Open(...)`      | Connects to SQLite DB file           | Sets up connection, enables queries    |
| `DB.Ping()`          | Tests DB connection                  | Ensures DB is reachable before queries |
| `filepath.Glob(...)` | Finds all SQL schema files           | Allows modular DB schema setup         |
| `os.ReadFile(...)`   | Reads raw SQL commands from file     | Reads schema definitions dynamically   |
| `DB.Exec(sqlStmt)`   | Executes SQL commands on DB          | Creates tables, runs migrations        |
| `Exec` helper func   | Simplifies running queries elsewhere | Reusable API for executing SQL         |
