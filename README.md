# 🦄 Feelings Forum 🌈

Welcome to **Feelings Forum** — a cozy little corner of the internet where your thoughts, moods, and maybe even your weird late-night rants can find a home.

## What is this?

Honestly? I’m still figuring that out. Think of it as a *work in progress* hug for your feelings — a place to share, vent, or just say *hello* to your inner self.

Is it a forum?
Is it a diary?
Is it a quirky social club for mentally chaotic humans?
*Yes, yes, and absolutely yes.*

---

## Why am I sharing this?

Because feelings are messy. Life is messy. Code is messy (oh boy, the code). But that’s okay.
I’m building this in public, so if you’re here, welcome to the chaos! Grab some tea, pull up a chair, and maybe share a feeling or two.

## How to run this thing

* Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) installed.
* Run `go run .`
* Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`
* See some magic happen? Or… maybe some bugs. Both are normal here.

---

## Tech Stack 🛠️

* **Go** — for the backend magic and serving up your feelings
* **HTML & CSS** — because your feelings deserve some style (and a light/dark mode toggle so your eyes don’t revolt)
* **JavaScript** — just enough to make that toggle button work and maybe some future fun interactive vibes
* **Net/http package** — Go’s built-in web server toolkit, keeping things simple and smooth
* **No databases yet!** Just your feelings and some files on disk for now (working on it, promise)

---

## What’s next?

* Adding real forums, not just hello world vibes.
* Dark mode that won’t blind your eyeballs.
* Making sure this place is safe, comfy, and maybe even a little silly.

But hey, that’s kind of the point, right?
